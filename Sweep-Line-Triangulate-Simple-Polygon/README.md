# Sweep Line Triangulate Simple Polygon Front

This is visualization for the Sweep Line algorithm that finds triangulation of Simple Polygon. 

## Introduction

The visualization provides a visual representation of the random points that are creating simple polygon after clicking on Create polygon. First part of algorithm is decomposing simple polygon in monotone polygons. Second and last part of algorithm is triangulating monotone polygons. You can enter number of points.

## Usage

To use this visualizer, you can clone the repository and run the following command:

npm install


This will install all the necessary dependencies. You can then start the development server by running:

npm start


This will start the server and open the app in your default browser.
